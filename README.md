This code automates the evaluation of nail technician photos using the GPT-4o API. It begins by installing required packages and authenticating access to Google Drive and Google Sheets. It then loads candidate data from a Google Sheet, filtering out rows without photo links. For each unrated row, it fetches the image (supporting formats like JPG, PNG, HEIC, BMP, TIFF, and WebP), converts it to base64, and sends it to the GPT-4o API with a structured prompt. The prompt enforces a specific nail format: exactly one dark-colored nail, two light-colored nails, and two French manicure nails. If the photo does not meet this format, all rating attributes are set to zero with a "wrong format" note. Otherwise, GPT returns scores for polish application, cuticle work, nail shape, cleanliness, overall score, and a hire recommendation. Only new, unrated rows are processed to optimize API usage. Final results, including timestamps, are written back to the Google Sheet.
